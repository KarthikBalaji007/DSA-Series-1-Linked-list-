# DSA-Series-1-Linked-list

A simple but creative linked list implementation using **C**.

## 🔍 Overview

This project is part of my **DSA-Series**, aiming to strengthen my understanding of core
data structures while building a strong technical portfolio. 
This repository features an implementation of linked lists in C, demonstrating both my
 logic-building skills and programming style.

## 🚀 Goals

- Improve my understanding of pointers and dynamic memory in C.
- Build a reference project for interviews and personal growth.
- Demonstrate my ability to write clean, maintainable, and functional C code.

## 💡 Features

- Singly linked list implementation
- Insertion (at beginning, end, and position)
- Deletion (from beginning, end, and position)
- Display and count nodes
- Search for an element
- Dynamic memory handling

## 📁 Files

- `linked_list.c` – Main C file with the logic.
- `README.md` – Project overview and goals.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
